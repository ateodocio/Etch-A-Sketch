# Etch-A-Sketch
A project from The Odin Project that showcases my working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Etch-A-Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy which allows you to create visualizations on a grey screen.
This is a simple rendition of that.


### Summary
> Applied knowledge of DOM manipulation and DOM events through JS
> Improved code readability and structure
> Used CSS3 flex to create game grid layout
